# RSS Newsletter - Persistence Fixes

## Problem Identified

The original RSS newsletter application was experiencing content disappearing after approximately 30 minutes. This was caused by:

1. **Non-persistent file storage**: The application stored data in `feed-data.json` in the application directory, which gets reset when containers restart
2. **No volume mounting**: Deployment configurations lacked persistent volume mounts
3. **Lack of backup mechanisms**: No backup/restore functionality for data recovery
4. **Missing error handling**: Limited error handling for file operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Persistence (`server-fixed.js`)

- **Separate data directory**: Data now stored in configurable `data/` directory
- **Environment variable support**: `DATA_DIR` environment variable for custom data paths
- **Atomic file writes**: Prevents data corruption during writes
- **Automatic backup creation**: Creates `.backup` files before each write
- **Error recovery**: Attempts to restore from backup if main file is corrupted
- **Enhanced metadata**: Tracks creation time, last modified, and version

### 2. Improved Deployment Configuration

#### Docker (`Dockerfile-fixed`)
- **Persistent volume**: `/app/data` volume for data persistence
- **Health checks**: Built-in health check endpoint
- **Environment variables**: Configurable data directory

#### Render.com (`render-fixed.yaml`)
- **Persistent disk**: 1GB persistent disk mounted at data directory
- **Health check path**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring
- **Environment variables**: Production-ready configuration

#### Local Development (`docker-compose.yml`)
- **Named volume**: `rss_data` volume for local persistence
- **Health checks**: Container health monitoring
- **Easy management**: Start/stop commands in package.json

### 3. New Features Added

#### Health Check Endpoint (`/health`)
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-28T08:10:46.784Z",
  "dataFile": "/path/to/data/feed-data.json",
  "itemCount": 2,
  "lastModified": "2025-07-28T08:10:06.608Z",
  "uptime": 40.273825431
}
```

#### Backup Endpoint (`POST /api/backup`)
- Creates timestamped backup files
- Returns backup file path and timestamp
- Useful for manual data backup before major changes

#### Enhanced Homepage
- Shows current status information
- Displays item count and last modified time
- Shows data file location for debugging

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- **Graceful degradation**: Application continues running even if data file is corrupted
- **Automatic recovery**: Attempts to restore from backup files
- **Detailed logging**: Enhanced console output for debugging
- **Atomic operations**: Prevents partial writes that could corrupt data

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for local/testing)

```bash
# Build and start with persistent storage
npm run docker-build
npm run docker-run

# Stop the application
npm run docker-stop
```

### Option 2: Using Render.com (Production)

1. Use `render-fixed.yaml` as your render configuration
2. Ensure the persistent disk is properly configured
3. Deploy using `node server-fixed.js` as the start command

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the fixed server
npm start
# or directly: node server-fixed.js
```

## Environment Variables

- `DATA_DIR`: Custom path for data storage (default: `./data`)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

## API Endpoints

All original endpoints remain the same, plus new ones:

- `GET /health` - Health check and status information
- `POST /api/backup` - Create manual backup
- Enhanced responses include metadata and item counts

## Data Structure

The enhanced data structure includes metadata:

```json
{
  "feedInfo": { ... },
  "items": [ ... ],
  "metadata": {
    "created": "2025-07-28T08:10:06.608Z",
    "lastModified": "2025-07-28T08:10:06.608Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Add items via API**: Content should persist across server restarts
2. **Check health endpoint**: Verify system status and data file location
3. **Create backups**: Use backup endpoint before major changes
4. **Monitor logs**: Enhanced logging shows data operations

## Migration from Original

1. **Backup existing data**: Copy your current `feed-data.json`
2. **Update deployment**: Use new Docker/Render configurations
3. **Start fixed server**: Use `server-fixed.js` instead of `server.js`
4. **Verify persistence**: Add test items and restart to confirm data survives

The fixes ensure that your RSS feed content will persist correctly and won't disappear after 30 minutes or container restarts.
