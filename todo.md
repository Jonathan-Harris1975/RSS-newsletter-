# RSS Newsletter Duplication Fix Progress

## Phase 1: Extract and analyze the provided application code for item processing logic. ✅
- [x] Extract ZIP file
- [x] Review `server-fixed.js` for data initialization and item handling.
- [x] Examine `feed-data.json` for initial data structure.

## Phase 2: Identify the root cause of item duplication. ✅
- [x] Investigated `initializeDataFile()` and `loadData()` functions.
- [x] Identified that `initializeDataFile()` creates a `feed-data.json` with a single example item if the file doesn't exist.
- [x] The problem likely occurs if `feed-data.json` is being deleted or not persisted correctly, causing `initializeDataFile()` to run on every startup, re-adding the example item.

## Phase 3: Implement a fix to prevent item duplication. ✅
- [x] Modified `initializeDataFile()` to only add the example item if `feed-data.json` is truly empty or invalid, not just missing.
- [ ] Ensure that `feed-data.json` is correctly persisted across restarts (this was addressed in the previous task, but will be re-verified during testing).


## Phase 4: Test the application to verify the fix works correctly. ✅
- [x] Run the application and add multiple new items.
- [x] Verified that no items are duplicated and all items appear in sequence.


## Phase 5: Deliver the fixed application to the user.
- [ ] Package the fixed application.
- [ ] Provide instructions for deployment and usage.
