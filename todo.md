# RSS Newsletter Fix Progress

## Phase 1: Extract and analyze the uploaded RSS newsletter project ✅
- [x] Extract ZIP file
- [x] Analyze package.json and dependencies
- [x] Review server.js main application code
- [x] Review generateRSS.js utility
- [x] Check existing feed-data.json

## Phase 2: Identify the root cause of content disappearing after 30 minutes ✅
- [x] Install dependencies and start server
- [x] Test adding new items via API
- [x] Verify data persistence in feed-data.json
- [x] Check RSS feed generation
- [x] Review deployment configuration (Dockerfile, render.yaml)

**Analysis**: The application code itself is working correctly. Data persists to feed-data.json and RSS feed is regenerated properly. The 30-minute disappearing issue is likely related to:
1. Deployment platform (Render) potentially restarting containers
2. File system not being persistent in containerized environment
3. Missing volume mounts for data persistence

## Phase 3: Implement fixes to ensure content persistence ✅
- [x] Add persistent volume configuration for data storage
- [x] Implement enhanced data persistence with backup/restore mechanisms
- [x] Add environment variable configuration for data persistence
- [x] Update Dockerfile and render.yaml for proper data persistence
- [x] Add backup/restore mechanisms
- [x] Create docker-compose for local testing
- [x] Add health check endpoints
- [x] Implement atomic file writes and error handling

## Phase 4: Test the application to verify the fix works correctly ✅
- [x] Test local deployment with persistence
- [x] Verify data survives in separate data directory
- [x] Test API endpoints functionality
- [x] Verify RSS feed generation with new items
- [x] Test backup functionality
- [x] Confirm health check endpoint works

## Phase 5: Deliver the fixed application to the user
- [ ] Package fixed application
- [ ] Provide deployment instructions
- [ ] Document the changes made
