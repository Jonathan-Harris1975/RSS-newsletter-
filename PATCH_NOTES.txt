FILES
-----
routes/outro.js   — ESM, single default export; always injects sponsor line from data/books.json (with fallback).
routes/compose.js — ESM, robust /ready-for-tts; supports { main: { chunks: [...] } }, strips label prefixes, merges cleanly.

USAGE
-----
1) Replace your repo files with these.
2) Ensure server mounts: app.use("/compose", composeRouter);
3) Calls:
   - /main (no ?merge=1) -> returns { chunks: [...] }
   - /compose/ready-for-tts with { main: { chunks: [...] }, intro, outro } -> returns { ssml, normalized }
4) Set Content-Type: application/json and escape inner quotes in SSML attributes (e.g., time=\"600ms\").
